Need funding
I want a Laser Science phD or Optics phD whatever institution allows that. I think Imaging science at my current school is not respected enough and would look bad on fellowship applications. 
I do not think that the rigor at my current institution is sufficient so any other institution where the students are competitive and cut throat please contact me and I will transfer. 
The current plan is to make sure that no one marries me and ruins my dreams so I need to wear an engagement ring to ward off any harrassment in the field...it'd be one thing if I was actually respected, but please do not hit on me while in class or working. 
I do not want kids, they're debt dream ruiners. 
So dissertation on Optics and Laser Science and Math Modeling in the meantime. 
I love my research and astrophysics has been great, but reading about interferometers and beam splitting brings me back to my undergrad days at UR. 

Ahhh I love optics. Been engaged to it for seven years now. We met back in 2013. Laser saftey class was the greatest.
