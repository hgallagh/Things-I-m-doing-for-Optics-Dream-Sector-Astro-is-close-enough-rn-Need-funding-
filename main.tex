\section{Introduction}



\section{Past document reading all the magazines textbooks and optica jornals everyday...}

\section{How long have you been doing this?}

Well 17 I was introduced to it in my AP physics course... \\ 
Audited OPT 241, OPT 261 and OPT 287 ... Bentley...Vamivakas...Alonso...went to Boar's head to talk to them all. Studied with everyone in the program for several years...kept the network as well from the program. Needed money for my bs...since going back was not supported by my family...had to get a scholarship at the rival school. 

Read the textbooks at my new school while I was in their remedial math courses in my offtime instead of any netflix or whatever...was pretty antisocial so it is what it is. \\ 

Continue to keep in network with I guess my classmates to "colleagues" now. \\


\section{Avenues that I access this information}

\subsection{Podcasts}

All things photonics listened to them all...


\subsection{Colleagues mentioning something over drinks in their studies and then reading up on it that night to look like I know what I'm talking about}


\section{Things I like a lot}




\subsection{Spectroscopy}

Need to write more about what I know.

\subsection{Photonics}

Need to write more about what I know...
